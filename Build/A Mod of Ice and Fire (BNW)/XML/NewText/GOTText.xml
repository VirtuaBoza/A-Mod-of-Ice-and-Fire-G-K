			<Text>House Stark of Winterfell is one of the Great Houses of Westeros and the principal noble house of The North; many lesser houses are sworn to them. In days of old they ruled as Kings of Winter; since the Targaryen Conquest they have been Wardens of the North. Their seat, Winterfell, is an ancient castle renowned for its strength. Their sigil is a grey direwolf racing across a field of white, and their words are "Winter Is Coming," one of only a few house mottoes to be a warning rather than a boast. Members of the family tend to be lean of build and long of face, with dark brown hair and grey eyes. Several of the main point of view characters of the series are members of this house.</Text>

They are descendants of the First Men and still follow some of their ancient traditions and the Old Gods of the forest. The Starks were Kings of Winter in the North for many thousands of years from the Age of Heroes, possibly beginning with Bran the Builder. Ever since Bran constructed the Wall, the Starks have been friends of the Night's Watch, and have manned the Wall for thousands of years. The Night's King, the attainted 13th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, is said to have been a Stark, among his many possible origins. The Starks also helped repel several major wildling invasions, such as when they and their Umber bannermen defeated the Kings-Beyond-the-Wall like the brothers Gendel and Gorne, as well as Bael the Bard, who both sired and fought a Stark. For several millennia, the Starks were not the uncontested Kings of the North, but their primary antagonists the Boltons of the Dreadfort swore fealty some 1,000 years ago, ending their flesh-flaying ways. Meanwhile King Jon Stark drove pirates from the White Knife, and the Wolf's Den was built at its mouth. This stronghold and the city which grew up around it (White Harbor) was often granted to sons and grandsons of the King in the North or other bannermen before finally being granted to the Manderlys, a house exiled from the Reach and taken in by the Starks. King Jon's son Rickard defeated the Marsh King and married his daughter, bringing the Neck into Winterfell's realm under the lordship of House Reed. The Karstarks were founded when Karlon Stark, brother to the reigning king, helped crush a revolt of the Boltons and was granted a keep for his service. Finally, The Mormonts were granted Bear Island when King Rodrik Stark won it from the ironborn in a wrestling match. The Starks fought the Arryns of the Vale for the Three Sisters, eventually ceding control of the islands. Aside from the Karstarks, the Starks of Winterfell may have distant relatives elsewhere in the North, possibly in White Harbor and Barrowton. The last Stark King of the North was Torrhen, who submitted to Aegon the Conqueror at the end of the War of Conquest. Since that time the Starks have held the North for the kings of the Seven Kingdoms as Wardens of The North. Around 213AL, House Stark faced a difficult succession. Several Lords of Winterfell had perished fighting wars in the North against rebellious Skagosi, the wildling king Raymun Redbeard and other threats, leaving Beron Stark as the lord of the house. As he too lay slowly succumbing to wounds he received fighting Dagon Greyjoy and his ironborn, his wife and four other recent Stark widows struggled over who would succeed him. There were a number of potential heirs, with some ten Stark children about.</Text>

			<Text>The Dothraki rely greatly on their horses as these beasts are an intrinsic part of their nomadic society. They use them for food, transportation, for clothing, and as a source of materials for crafts, and their deity is the Great Stallion, mirroring the importance of horses in Dothraki culture. The Dothraki are especially skilled in horse riding and mounted warfare. They traverse the Dothraki Sea in tribes known as khalasars and are led by a khal. which are each led by one of the khal's captains, called kos. When a khal dies, a new khal may take control of the khalasar or the khas may break away and form new khalasars led by their former kos. Each khal has bloodriders. Part guardian, brother and companion, the bloodriders guard and accompany the khal in his daily routine. Ancient traditions proclaim that when a khal dies, his bloodriders die with him. Should the khal die in battle, the bloodriders live only long enough to avenge him and then die shortly after. Some khals are known to have shared not only their daily routines with their bloodriders, but their wives as well.[3] However, horses are never shared among the khal and his bloodriders. The khal and his bloodriders commonly refer to each other as "blood of my blood". Khalasars have no fixed settlements and rely heavily on raiding neighboring nations, and each other, for subsistence. Although they disdain the exchange of currency, they do give and accept gifts, often including slaves. Sometimes a strong khalasar may threaten one of the Free Cities to sack it or demand tribute, but their favorite target for slaving are the docile Lhazareen herders. Dothraki can erect large grass canopies for special occasions, but typically live in portable tents, always on the move. The Dothraki have only one permanent city, called Vaes Dothrak, which serves as their capital. While khalasars are typically rivals on the plains, in Vaes Dothrak all Dothraki must behave as brothers. No one may spill blood or draw a blade in the city, on pain of death. The wives of khals, called khaleesis, live in Vaes Dothrak once widowed. There they rule over all the khals as the dosh khaleen. The Dothraki speak an eponymous language of their own. All horselords affect a bowlegged swagger when forced to dismount and stride the earth like common mortals.</Text>

Their seat is Casterly Rock, though another branch exists that is based in nearby Lannisport. Their sigil is a golden lion on a field of crimson. Their official motto is "Hear me roar!" However their unofficial motto, equally well known, is "A Lannister always pays his debts." The Lannisters reigned as Kings of the Rock until they fell to the Targaryen conquest, but were allowed to remain the paramount lords of the Westerlands. The House had fallen on hard times during Tytos rule but was restored to its former glory by Tywin. The Lannisters are the richest family in the Seven Kingdoms, due in large part to the many gold mines under their control, despite by no means being the largest kingdom and being rather mountainous.</Text>

			<Text>The Lannisters descend from Andal adventurers who married the daughters of the King of the Rock. The King himself descended from Lann the Clever, a legendary trickster from the Age of Heroes who tricked the Casterlys into giving him Casterly Rock. The Lannisters reigned as Kings of the Rock until the Targaryen conquest. Afer the Field of Fire, King Loren I surrendered and his House was allowed to remain the paramount lords of the westerlands. The Lannisters are the richest family in the Seven Kingdoms, due in large part to the many gold mines under their control. House Lannister once possessed an ancestral Valyrian steel greatsword called Brightroar; but it has long been lost. During the Blackfyre Rebellion, Lord Damon Lannister remained loyal to the Targaryens. The great rebel general Ser Quentyn Ball defeated him outside the gates of Lannisport. Later, during the lordship of Tytos Lannister, the House fell on hard times. Tytos' weakness allowed him to be bullied by his vassals. Eventually his son Tywin brought the wayward bannermen to heel and restored the house to its former glory. Soon thereafter, Tywin was made Hand of the King by Aerys II, holding that position for many years. When Aerys was held hostage by Denys Darklyn, Tywin's conservative approach took six months to resolve the conflict. This instigated Aerys's paranoia and drove a wedge between the two, along with the king's lusting after Tywin's wife, cousin and trusted confidante Joanna. Tywin was never a jovial man, but when Joanna died birthing their third child, Tyrion, he was much saddened and his brother Kevan became his right hand. Their sister Genna took a maternal role over the children. His second brother Tygett died of a pox, and their brother Gerion sailed off on a journey to Valyria, never to be seen again. Despite Tywin's attempts to ensure a strong legacy, life at Casterly Rock was dysfunctional at best. His twin children Cersei and Jaime began an incestuous relationship at an early age. Cersei, while a young maid, visited a woods witch called Maggy the Frog, who shared portents of Cersei's future that planted seeds of her paranoia. Cersei murdered her friend who had witnessed the prophecy. Tyrion, when 13 years old, was out with Jaime when he met and married a girl named Tysha, a match which was quickly and savagely ended by Lord Tywin. Jaime was a promising young knight, dubbed by Ser Arthur Dayne. Tywin was devastated when Jaime joined King Aery's Kingsguard. Upon this action (which he perceived as the Mad King "stealing" his heir), coupled with the Mad King's refusal to wed Prince Rhaegar to Cersei, Tywin resigned the Handship. This flew in the face of Jaime's plan, which was to be closer to Cersei: he was kept in King's Landing while Cersei returned to Casterly Rock. During Robert's Rebellion, the Lannisters stayed neutral for the majority of the war. Only after the defeat of Prince Rhaegar at the Trident did Lord Tywin bestir himself to join Robert Baratheon against the Targaryen dynasty, perpetrating the Sack of King's Landing when the Lannister loyalist Grand Maester Pycelle suggested the gates be opened. There Ser Jaime Lannister, still a Kingsguard, slew Aerys, the last crowned Targaryen king. Meanwhile Tywin's knights killed the rest of the Targaryens in the capitol to prove their commitment to Robert's cause. Afterwards, Tywin's daughter Cersei was wed to King Robert. This marriage and the increasing amount of gold Robert owes to Tywin have only increased Lannister power.

			<Text>Baratheon is the youngest of the original great houses, tracing its descent from Orys Baratheon, one of Aegon I's fiercest generals, and rumored to be his bastard brother. Through the female line, the Baratheons are descended from the Storm Kings, as Orys slew Argilac the Arrogant, last of the Storm Kings, and married his daughter Argella Durrendon. Orys adopted the sigil and words of his wife's ancestral line. The line of the Storm Kings dates back to the Age of Heroes when their kingdom was founded by King Durran I "Godsgrief", a legendary hero.	During the Blackfyre Rebellion, the Baratheons remained loyal to the Targaryen Dynasty, providing much of the force commanded by Prince Baelor Breakspear at the decisive Battle of the Redgrass Field. Princess Rhaelle Targaryen, daughter of Aegon V, married into the House and birthed Lord Steffon Baratheon, continuing the close ties between the dragon and the stag. The rebellion that usurped the Targaryens, however, was started on behalf of Steffon's son Lord Robert Baratheon and his foster-brother, Eddard Stark. The Baratheons and their bannermen were instrumental in the conflict, along with Houses Arryn, Stark, and Tully, and, eventually, House Lannister. The Battle of Summerhall and Siege of Storm's End were fixtures of the Stormlands theater. After the war, the house spawned two cadet branches: one seated on the Iron Throne under King Robert, and another on the Isle of Dragonstone headed by Lord Stannis. During the Greyjoy Rebellion against Robert's rule, the combined Baratheon fleet defeated the Iron Fleet in the Battle of Fair Isle, commanded by Master of Ships Stannis. Stannis later subdued Great Wyk in his brother's name, presumably commanding the stormlords' hosts to do so.</Text>

During the Targaryen dynasty, the seat of Dragonstone was given to the heir to the Iron Throne. The lands of Storm's End are considerably larger and richer than those of Dragonstone, giving Renly more power than his older brother. During his time in Storm's End, Renly took Loras Tyrell as a squire, with whom he forged a close friendship that continues to this day. Some time after he became a man, Renly was named to the small council as Master of Laws. While at court, his castellan at Storm's End was Ser Cortnay Penrose, who was also responsible for rearing Robert's bastard son Edric Storm.</Text>

The Greyjoys became the lords paramount of the Iron Isles during the Targaryen Conquest: after Aegon I extinguished House Hoare, he allowed the ironborn to choose who would have primacy over them. They chose Vickon Greyjoy and his line. The Greyjoys have ruled ever since, from their formidable castle of Pyke. The ironborn, however, did lose the Riverlands, which were granted to Edmyn Tully and his descendents. Thus relegated to their dismal homeland and constrained by the king's peace, the Greyjoys have kept themselves distant from the other Great Houses, rarely taking part in events on the mainland (which they call the "green lands"). At various times they have tried to return to their ancient practices of raiding the western coastlines, such as under Lord Dagon. Six years after holding aloof during Robert's Rebellion, Lord Balon Greyjoy led his own rebellion against the Iron Throne, declaring himself King of the Iron Islands. He was defeated, his fleet burned and his two eldest sons Rodrik and Maron were slain during the war. His last son Theon was given as a hostage and ward to Lord Eddard Stark and he again swore fealty to House Baratheon of King's Landing.	Since their revolt, the Greyjoys have been as insular as ever. With Theon living in the green lands, Lord Balon raised his daughter Asha as his heir. Balon exiled his brother Euron when he raped the rock wife of their brother Victarion, Lord Captain of the Iron Fleet. Victarion was forced to kill his wife to retain his honor. Since then Euron has sailed the world aboard the Silence, reaving and pillaging, unwelcome in the Isles while Balon still lives. Another brother, Aeron Damphair, had been changed by his experience of washing overboard during the Battle of Fair Isle, and became a priest of the Drowned God.</Text>

By thirteenth year, he had become an expert oarsman. At fifteen he sailed with Dagmer Cleftjaw to the Stepstones on a reaving, killing his first man and taking his first two salt wives there. By seventeen he captained his own longship. Later he often went raiding and was known for his fierceness and fearlessness. He succeeded his father as Lord Reaper of Pyke when the latter died during a raiding journey. When he returned to Pyke he found out his younger brother Urrigon had died of gangrene after being injured in the finger dance. The maester had tried to save the hand of the boy but his potions had failed and Urrigon (14 years old) lost his life instead. Balon commanded the same treatment be used on the maester, who died along with Balon's stepmother.

			<Text>It was formed in 283 Al after the War of the Usurper when the new king, Robert I, named his younger brother, Stannis, Prince of Dragonstone. Stannis took the title as a slight, since he would have preferred the richer lands of Storm's End, the ancestral Baratheon castle, but Robert wanted a strong leader in the old seat of House Targaryen. Around 287, Lord Stannis took Selyse Florent to wife. During the Greyjoy Rebellion of 289, Stannis, as Robert's Master of Ships, led the Baratheon fleets to victory in the Battle of Fair Isle. Since then Stannis and Selyse have conceived their daughter, Shireen, although their marriage remains loveless.</Text>

			<Text>Stannis was born the second son to Steffon Baratheon and Cassana Estermont, the younger brother of the Robert Baratheon and older brother of Renly Baratheon. His parents died when he was thirteen. Even in his youth he was said to be a serious, dour and humorless boy. Stannis's stubbornness and determination are legendary and served him well during Robert's Rebellion, when he successfully held the castle of Storm's End against Mace Tyrell's siege, lasting the majority of the war, unintentionally ensuring one of the largest loyalist forces didnt take the field against the rebels. His garrison held under desperate conditions, only avoiding starvation by the timely intervention of a smuggler, Davos Seaworth. His cargo of onions allowed them to hold the fortress. After the siege was lifted by Lord Eddard Stark, Stannis took Davos Seaworth into his service, dubbing him "The Onion Knight." True to Stannis' inflexible sense of justice, he also punished Seaworth for his crimes as a smuggler by removing the first joint from each finger of Seaworth's left hand, as payment for his past crimes. Seaworth accepted the punishment provided Stannis carry it out himself. King Robert charged Stannis with leading a fleet to seize Dragonstone, which was still loyal to the Targaryens at that point. After completing the mission, Stannis was displeased to discover that King Robert had named him Lord of Dragonstone, instead of the wealthier Storm's End, which was given to their younger brother Renly, who hadn't done anything of true note during the war. However, Robert needed a strong ruler to control what had been a holdout of the Mad King's loyalists, and Stannis was much more suited for this role than Renly was. It had the added advantage of taking prickly Stannis away from the mainland of Westeros. True to his nature, Stannis was an effective and efficient administrator for Dragonstone. Stannis was appointed to the small council as well, as the Master of Ships. During the Greyjoy Rebellion, Stannis commanded the royal fleet and trapped and destroyed much of the Iron Fleet. Afterwards, he subdued Great Wyk in his brother's name. While he was at court, Stannis left Ser Axell Florent as castellan of Dragonstone. During his wedding to Lady Selyse Florent, King Robert deflowered Delena Florent on Stannis's wedding bed. This coupling led to the birth of Edric Storm, the only acknowledged bastard of the king. Stannis insisted that he was a blight upon the honor of his wife's House and promptly shipped him off to his other uncle, Lord Renly, at Storm's End.	Despite Stannis's loyalty and service to his brother Robert, Robert gave Stannis little in return; instead of thanking him for holding Storm's End against the Tyrells he thanked Eddard Stark for lifting the siege instead. Instead of thanking Stannis for capturing Dragonstone for him, Robert blamed Stannis for the escape of Viserys and Daenerys Targaryen (even though they fled long before Stannis's newly built fleet had even arrived). According to Cersei Lannister Robert even meant Stannis receiving Dragonstone as a slight. Stannis helped Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, in ruling the kingdom but got little or no acknowledgement or thanks from his elder brother who spent all his time, hunting, drinking and whoring. Stannis never complained publicly since service without expectation of reward was required of him in his positions.	Just prior to the events of A Game of Thrones, Stannis suspected that the children of Queen Cersei Lannister were not actually Robert's. He confided his suspicions to Lord Arryn, and they investigated the matter together. Stannis did not bring his suspicions to Robert, as he knew Robert would not believe the charges coming from him (Robert had no love for his brother Stannis, and Stannis would be seen as making himself heir), but would listen if the charges came from Jon Arryn whom Robert loved. They visited several of Robert's baseborn children in the city and Stannis pointed out that all had black hair and they looked like Robert, while Lord Jon consulted the book The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms of past marriages of Noble Houses and discovered the same was true: whenever a Baratheon wed, their sons and daughters would have black hair, even if the other parent was a golden-haired Lannister. After determining that the children were in fact not Robert's, Lord Jon meant to act and even planned for his son Robert Arryn to be fostered with Stannis on Dragonstone. However, Lord Arryn was poisoned before he could bring the evidence before Robert.</Text>

			<Text>House Targaryen sigil is a three-headed dragon breathing flames, red on black. The three-headed dragon represents Aegon the Conqueror and his two sisters, Rhaenys and Visenya, Their house words are "Fire and Blood." Although the Targaryen kings took their seat at King's Landing, the place where Aegon and his army first landed in Westeros and made their first fort, Dragonstone remained the traditional seat of the heir-apparent to the throne. House Targaryen historically followed the gods of Valyria. Sometime before the conquest of the Seven Kingdoms, the Targaryens abandoned the Valyrian gods and converted to the Faith of the Seven, the predominant religion in Westeros. However, they continued to follow the Valyrian practice of incestuous marriage, wedding brother to sister, cousin to cousin, and uncle to niece, holding themselves apart from and above the noble Westerosi families. The phrase "blood of the dragon" refers to what are considered typical Targaryen features: silvery-gold (or platinum) hair and violet eyes. Some Targaryens also have a high tolerance of heat, though they are by no means immune to fire. Another trait typical to Targaryens, and one that was passed on to the cadet house, House Blackfyre, was the ability to have premonition-like dreams. Aenar Targaryen was a noble in Valyria before the Doom, whose maiden daughter had his visions written down and published in a book called Signs and Portents. Probably due to their incestuous practices, the Targaryens are prone to madness; King Jaehaerys II said that with the birth of a new Targaryen the gods tossed a coin to decide whether the child would be great or mad.</Text>

			<Text>Daenerys is the only daughter and youngest child of King Aerys II Targaryen and his sister-wife, Queen Rhaella. Daenerys was conceived during the last month of the rebellion that would ultimately end her family's reign over the Seven Kingdoms. Shortly thereafter, her mother was sent with the young prince Viserys to the family ancestral seat of Dragonstone to escape the coming Sack of King's Landing. Daenerys was born while a great storm raged above Dragonstone, sinking what remained of the Targaryen fleet, for this reason she is sometimes known as "Daenerys Stormborn." Her mother died during labor. By this time, the war was already lost. Robert Baratheon had claimed the throne and Aerys had already been killed along with the rest of the royal family, leaving Daenerys and her older brother Viserys as the only living Targaryen heirs. The garrison at Dragonstone decided to surrender and turn them over to the rebels in exchange for their lives, but before they could act on this plan, Ser Willem Darry and several other loyal retainers rescued the children and smuggled them into exile, sailing to the Free City of Braavos, where they lived for years in a house with a red door. Ser Willem was old and sickly, but Dany remembers that he always treated her kindly. After his death, the servants drove the young Targaryens from the house. Dany wept as they were forced out. The Targaryen loyalists who raised the two children considered Viserys the rightful ruler of the Seven Kingdoms despite the family's defeat and exile, as did Viserys himself. He regarded it as his duty to revenge himself on the usurpers who murdered his family and reclaim the birthright that had been stolen from him when he was only a child. In the years that followed Ser Willem's death, Viserys wandered the nine Free Cities with his sister, trying to raise support to retake the Iron Throne, which earned him the mocking title of "The Beggar King." As a result of this long humiliation, Viserys grew bitter and obsessed with his long-denied birthright. Dany was the only convenient target for his frustration, and over time he even came to blame her for their mother's death. He took pride in his lack of control of his own temper, regarding it as proof that he was a true heir to the Targaryen kings; he regularly warned Dany not to "wake the dragon" by angering him. He often spoke to her of the importance of preserving the purity of their royal bloodline through the ancient Valyrian practice of dynastic incest, so Dany grew up believing she would one day wed her brother. She was bright enough to realize that most of Viserys' plans for retaking the Seven Kingdoms were unrealistic, and as she had no memory of Westeros herself, his dream meant little to her; instead she longed to return to the house with the red door, which in her mind became a symbol for the childhood she had lost. With no family other than the abusive Viserys and no expectation of ever escaping his control, Dany grew into a fearful and docile young woman. The two last Targaryens eventually found the help they sought in the Free City of Pentos, in the form of a rich and powerful magister, Illyrio Mopatis, who invited them to stay in his manse and offered his help in reclaiming their throne.</Text>

			<Text>The Tyrells trace their line of descent, through the female line, to the legendary Garth Greenhand, the first King of the Reach, in the Age of Heroes(indicating their origin among the Andal invaders thousands of years before). The Tyrells were stewards to House Gardener, the ancient ruling line of Kings of the Reach, who periodically intermarried with lower ranking houses of the Reach such as House Tyrell or House Florent. Following the defeat and death of King Mern IX, at the Field of Fire, Lord Harlen Tyrell, hereditary high steward of the Reach, surrendered Highgarden and was granted the castle along with dominion of the Reach by Aegon the Conqueror. As Wardens of the South they frequently warred with the Dornishmen, who remained independent.</Text>

'Nymeros' indicates "of the line of Nymeria," but generally it is simply called House Martell. The Martells of old used a spear as their emblem, while Nymeria and the Rhoynar used the sun as theirs. These were combined when Nymeria wed King Mors Martell into a gold spear piercing a red sun on an orange field. Their words are, "Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken." In appearance they are classic salty Dornishmen, with dark eyes, dark hair in ringlets, and olive skin.</Text>

			<Text>House Martell's founding is unknown, except that they were one of the ruling families of Dorne which, since the Andal Invasion had been a collection of feuding petty kingdoms even as the other regions of Westeros began to consolidate into larger realms. When the warrior queen of the Rhoynar of the eastern continent, Nymeria, came with her people to Westeros, she took one of the strongest of the Dornishmen as her husband: King Mors Martell. Combining their strength, the two managed to unite all of Dorne under their rule; House Nymeros Martell has reigned since.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The union of their peoples saw the Martells abandon many of their older Andal customs in favor of those of the Rhoynar. Specifically, they began to call their rulers "princes" instead of kings, and their lands and title passed down to the eldest child regardless of gender.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As Aegon the Conqueror waged his Wars of Conquest, he eventually came to Dorne. Here his army was bled dry by guerrilla warfare in the desert, a situation in which his dragons were of little use. Deciding that conquering Dorne would be too costly, the Conqueror opted to leave the Martells as sovereign princes. House Martell kept Dorne independent from the Targaryens for two centuries, the only one of the Seven Kingdoms to manage such a feat. After repeated failed attempts at conquest (most notably under Daeron I), Dorne eventually joined the fold through marriage between the two houses. The alliance was a dual one, with the future King Daeron II marrying Princess Myriah Martell and Prince Maron Martell later marrying Daeron's sister Daenerys.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During Daeron II's reign, the Red Keep assumed a decidedly Dornish flavor due to the influence of his Martell wife. This was one reason that many nobles opted to rise against his rule. The Martells thus defended his claim against Daemon Blackfyre. After their victory, Maron and Daenerys fulfilled their betrothal, formally bringing Dorne into the Seven Kingdoms. Since then, the Martells have ruled Dorne in the name of the King on the Iron Throne, while keeping the title of Prince of Dorne.</Text>

They fell in love and married. Although Mellario was high born enough to become his wife, most marriages between nobles in Westeros are political marriages and a love match is very uncommon. The couple had three children.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although they married out of love, the marriage was not very happy. Mellario could not get used to Dornish customs. Shortly after the birth of Trystane, Quentyn was sent to be fostered as the ward and squire of Lord Anders Yronwood. This was done to make peace with the Yronwoods after the previous Lord Ormond Yronwood had died of his wounds taken in a duel with Oberyn. Mellario did not approve and went back to Norvos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In his fifties, Doran became badly afflicted with gout, losing much of his ability to walk, and so is usually confined to a wheelchair. He spends a great deal of time at the Water Gardens, the summer home of the Martells, watching children play. He avoids the commoners and only sees his trusted courtiers and advisors to hide his weakness from his enemies.</Text>

			<Text>Greetings, Mance Rayder! You lead the tribal Free Folk from Beyond the Wall. The wall separates the Free Folk from the rest of the Westeros, and in many ways it defines them. Due to their isolation from the rest of Westeros, they remain a free people, free of states, free of nobles, kings, and laws but those of their own choosing, following whatever leader they please. They believe that the gods made the earth for all men to share and when the kings came with their crowns and their steel swords, they stole it - by claiming it was all theirs and theirs alone.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]They won't dance for coins, they don't care how you style yourself or what that chain of office means or who your grandsire was. They follow strength. They follow the man.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the game of thrones, you win or you die, Mance Rayder. Do you have the strength to lead the Free Folk south of the wall and defeat the iron throne?</Text>

He was a loyal member of the Night's Watch for most of his life until he suffered an injury while ranging, and was healed by a wildling woman. While he recuperated, she mended his torn cloak with swatches of red fabric. Upon returning to the Wall, the Night's Watch commanders required him to replace his mended cloak with one of uniform black. This infringement of freedom caused him to abandon the Night's Watch and live with the wildlings in the way he wished.</Text>

The House submitted to House Targaryen when Aegon the Conqueror's sister Visenya arrived at the Eyrie and found that the young king Ronnel wanted to ride a dragon.
