(For example, Winterfell might generate 1 Singer and 2 Builder GP pts each turn. After 3 turns it would have 3 Singer points and 6 Builder GP pts. The two types of points are not pooled.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When a city has enough of a specific type of GP points, the points are expended to generate a Great Person of that type. Once a Great Person is generated, the amount required for the next Great Person increases in all of cities for that player.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For instance, say that a player needs to acquire 10 GP pts to get a Great Person. From the previous example, in five turns Winterfell would have enough Builder GP pts. to create a Great Builder. After the Great Builder was created, Winterfell would have 0 Great Builder points and 5 Great Singer points left, and the amount required for the next Great Person would increase to say 15 points. Eight turns later Winterfell would have 13 Great Singer points and 16 Great Builder points, and it would generate another Great Builder.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Note that a Garden building increases the rate at which you generate Great People, and that the Warrior Code social policy immediately generates a Great Commander."/>
